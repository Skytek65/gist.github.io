**Gist** is the fastest, most private way to summarize text on your iPhone. Powered by advanced on-device AI, Gist transforms long emails, articles, and notes into clear, concise bullet points—instantly.

## ✨ Why Gist?

### 🔒 100% Private
Your data never leaves your device. Gist runs entirely offline using Apple Intelligence, ensuring your personal information stays yours. No servers. No cloud. No tracking.

### ⚡️ Lightning Fast
No loading bars or server delays. Just copy text from any app—Mail, Safari, Notes, Slack—and open Gist. The summary is ready before you even look.

### 📱 Universal
Works with everything. If you can copy it, Gist can summarize it.
